# Phat's Independent Development Assignment
I decide to follow the [Indigo Card Game](https://hyperskill.org/projects/214?track=18) track and better understand creating a card game. Hopefully, I can build a Pokemon card game based on this tutorial.

# Reflection
## Week 4
The "Indigo Card Game" track has five stages in total, and I will complete the first stage for this week's work. I can see most of the topics look familiar to me at a glance. Thus, this stage is a good chance to recap my understanding of Kotlin. Meanwhile, I  focus on coding conventions and idiomatic.

- Where might I face challenges in the assigned work?
- Are things progressing as I expected?
- Is there anything I can, or should, do to make this more successful?
- What did I particularly value in the process and why?
