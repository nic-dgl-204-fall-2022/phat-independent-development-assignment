# Phat's Independent Development Assignment
I decide to follow the [Indigo Card Game](https://hyperskill.org/projects/214?track=18) track and better understand creating a card game. Hopefully, I can build a game based on this tutorial.

# Reflection
## Week 4 [Stage 1 / 5]
The "Indigo Card Game" track has five stages in total, and I will complete the first stage for this week's work. Most of the topics look familiar to me at a glance. Thus, I decide to go through each material and do the practice to recap my understanding of Kotlin. 

- _Where might I face challenges in the assigned work?_

  > I think the only topic of "Work on project" would take me more time because most topics are covered with my understanding of Kotlin. However, I will try my best not to skip any practice in the first stage as much as possible. 

- _Are things progressing as I expected?_

  > At first, I thought it would be quick to do all the topics in stage 1. However, it took me a very long time to be able to complete all the practices. In contrast, the "work on project" task is pretty straightforward and requires printing a few lists.

- _Is there anything I can, or should, do to make this more successful?_

  > By following along with the track, I realize reading comments from others is very helpful. They help me understand more about the task because some of them are not very clear. In addition, I can see solutions from others and learn from their approach. In the next stages, I think I will pay more attention to comments if I get stuck.

- _What did I particularly value in the process and why?_

  > Since most of stage 1 covers the basics about Kotlin, I learned something interesting that I did not acknowledge before: 
  > - I can write underscores in integers more readable. For example: "1000000" can be re-write as "1_000_000" or "1__000_000".
  > - I can use the "const val" identifier to declare a constant variable. Only primitives and strings are allowed. And it must be declared on the top level, outside of any functions.
